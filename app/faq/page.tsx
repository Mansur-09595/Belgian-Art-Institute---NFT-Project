                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  Founded in 2014, the Belgian Art Institute is an independent organization uniting collectors, researchers, and connoisseurs of art. We are dedicated to the study, preservation, and interpretation of artistic heritage, combining classical methodologies with contemporary technologies.

                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  The Institute focuses on the attribution of artworks, technical analysis, provenance research, and the re-evaluation of forgotten or misinterpreted works. Special attention is given to late 19thâ€“early 20th century painting, particularly Impressionism.

                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  We see Web3 not as a passing trend, but as a culturally necessary extension of our institutional mission. Through blockchain and decentralized infrastructures, we ensure the preservation and authenticity of artworks in the digital age.

                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  For many years, the Institute operated discreetly, serving private collections and guaranteeing anonymity to their owners. Today, we are opening part of our archives and case studies to a wider audience through educational and digital projects.

                  As a token of gratitude for participation within the first 48 hours after the start of a collection's public release, the Institute will gift a second digital asset (NFT) to each early purchaser. This gesture is symbolic recognition and support â€” not a market mechanism â€” and reflects the ethics of reciprocity and trust at the core of the project.
